# 1. Customer Shopping Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the initial exploration and cleaning of a customer shopping dataset collected from various shopping malls. The dataset contains detailed records of customer transactions, including demographics, purchase details, and payment methods. The primary objective of this project is to clean and analyze the data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

This project is divided into three main steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Statistical Analysis**
3. **Data Visualization and Advanced Analysis**

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
  - Convert date columns to a usable format and eliminate inconsistencies.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Summarize key numerical columns using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (variance, standard deviation).
  - Provide basic interpretations of customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

- **Data Visualization and Advanced Analysis**:
  - Visualize the distribution of key numerical variables.
  - Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between variables.
  - Conduct segmented and time-series analyses to identify trends in spending and revenue.
  - Detect and analyze outliers in high-value transactions.

## Key Insights

1. **Demographics**:
   - Customers are predominantly aged 30-50 years.
   - Gender distribution shows no significant spending differences between males and females.

2. **Purchasing Behavior**:
   - Most transactions involve 1-3 items, with Shoes being the most expensive category.
   - High-value outliers are concentrated in the Shoes category, priced around $2,400.

3. **Trends**:
   - Seasonal spikes in monthly revenue suggest opportunities for targeted marketing during peak periods.

4. **Outliers**:
   - 2,022 high-value transactions were identified, emphasizing the importance of premium products in driving revenue.

## Next Steps

The cleaned dataset is ready for:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Delve deeper into trends and patterns through advanced visualizations and statistical techniques.
- **Modeling and Prediction**: Develop models to predict customer behavior and segment the customer base for targeted strategies.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and statistical calculations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for developing and documenting the project.
